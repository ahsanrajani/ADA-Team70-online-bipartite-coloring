## Code Structure Overview

### **1. Class: `BipartiteGraphColoring`**
This is the core class responsible for:
- Representing the bipartite graph.
- Implementing edge coloring algorithms.
- Validating the correctness of the coloring.
- Benchmarking performance across various scenarios.

#### **Key Methods:**
- `__init__(...)`: Initializes graph parameters, including nodes, palettes, and internal data structures.
- `color_graph()`: Executes the hybrid coloring algorithm for efficient edge coloring.
- `process_online_node(online_node)`: Dynamically processes edges as they arrive.
- `validate_coloring()`: Ensures the coloring adheres to edge coloring rules.
- `greedy_coloring_algorithm()`: Implements the standard greedy edge coloring algorithm.

### **2. Function: `main()`**
Automates testing of the algorithms on various bipartite graph structures.

#### **Test Cases:**
- Complete Bipartite Graphs (e.g., `K10,10`, `K100,100`).
- Star Topology.
- Sparse Graphs (e.g., Perfect Matching).
- Hybrid and Adversarial Graphs.

For each test:
- Runs both the hybrid and greedy algorithms.
- Logs results, including the number of colors used and execution time.

### **3. Output Handling**
- Results are saved to `output.txt` for analysis.
- Includes detailed logs of algorithm performance.
