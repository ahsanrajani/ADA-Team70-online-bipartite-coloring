# Deterministic Online Bipartite Edge Coloring

This repository contains our project for **CS/CE 412/471 – Spring 2025**.

We are implementing and analyzing the algorithm from the paper:

## Project Summary

The goal is to explore a deterministic algorithm that outperforms the greedy method for online edge coloring in bipartite graphs. This algorithm achieves a competitive ratio better than 2 for large maximum degrees.
