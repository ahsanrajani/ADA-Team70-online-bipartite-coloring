Algorithm 3: Online Edge Coloring

Input:
- G: Input graph arriving online.
- Δ: Maximum degree of G.

Steps:
1. Launch executions 0, . . . , f − 1 of Algorithm 1 with parameters Δ0, . . . , Δf−1 and distinct palettes.
2. For each online node vt on arrival:
    a. Et ← edges incident to vt.
    b. For i = 1, . . . , f:
        i. Provide online arrival of vt with edges Et to execution i of Algorithm 1.
        ii. Et ← Et \ {edges colored by the above execution}.
    c. Color remaining set Et greedily using a fixed palette which is distinct from copies of Algorithm 1.
