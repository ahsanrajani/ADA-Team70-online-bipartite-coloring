Algorithm 2: Contention Resolution Scheme

Input:
- Rc: conflicting edges
- −→xc: Probability of conflicting edges to select that color

    a. For each e ∈ Rc: // for each conflicting edge
        '''
        this formula gives us the fair chance (probability) that a specific edge i should receive a contested item, 
        given that multiple players requested it — while respecting the original probability weights p. For detailed
        explanation of this formula, refer to crs_explained.pdf document in <Research Material> folder
        '''
        i. r_Rc_e = (1 / ∑(−→xc)) * [ 
                            ∑_{f ∈ Rc \ {e}} −→xc[f] / (|Rc| - 1) +    
                            ∑_{f ∉ Rc} −→xc[f] / |Rc| 
                      ].
    b. Randomly select an edge e ∈ Rc with probability r_Rc_e.
    c. Return e as the selected edge.
